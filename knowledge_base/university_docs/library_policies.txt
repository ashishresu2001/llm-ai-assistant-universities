If there is noise in your study area that you believe to be excessive, you are encouraged to ask the noise
maker(s) to be quiet. If you feel uncomfortable doing so or if the users refuse to cooperate, please report the
disturbance to a library service desk on the second ﬂoor.
 
Cell Phone Use
Keep cell phones on silent mode throughout the library.
Send and receive calls in the ﬁrst ﬂoor and the second ﬂoor lobby.
Food & Drink
Food & covered beverages are allowed in most library study areas; however:
Be considerate of others when eating foods that are messy, noisy or aromatic/smelly.
Clean up after yourself. Alert library staﬀ to spills that need attention.
No food or beverages are allowed in the Special Collections Department.

Accessibility Animals
Service Animals
Service animals, as deﬁned by the Americans with Disabilities Act, are allowed in the library. Under the ADA, a
service animal is deﬁned as a dog or miniature horse that has been individually trained to do work or perform
tasks for an individual with a disability. The task(s) performed by the animal must be directly related to the
person’s disability.
 
Emotional Support Animals
Emotional support animals are intended to provide emotional support, well-being, comfort, or companionship
to their owners. While these are allowed in some campus areas, they are not allowed in the library without
express permission.

Borrowing from the Library (/library/services/borrowing/)
Circulation Policies
Policy Updated: July 2018
 
Borrower Responsibilities
Borrowers are responsible for any materials checked out on their library cards, including materials from other
libraries. This includes returning or renewing materials by the due date and time, returning items in the
condition in which they were borrowed, and being accountable for overdue ﬁnes or fees.
Patrons are sent an email receipt that indicates when the materials are due. Borrowers also receive a monthly
email that lists the titles and due dates of the materials they have checked out. The Library will also e-mail
notices to borrowers when materials are recalled. [See Recalls section below].
A faculty member may appoint students or staﬀ members as a proxy patron to check out materials on the
Faculty member’s account. Proxy patrons must be UT Dallas students or staﬀ with a valid current UTD ID
(Comet Card) and must be approved by the Head of Access Services.
The Library sends notices as a courtesy only. The Library is NOT responsible for non-delivery of notices.
Please advise the Library of a change in contact information to ensure your notices arrive.
In accordance with the Attorney General of Texas Open Record Decision No. 100, the UT Dallas Libraries will
not release information about a borrower including name, UTD ID, or check out information.
 
Renewals
Borrowers may renew materials through Discover (https://utdallas.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?
vid=01UT_DALLAS:UTDALMA&lang=en&sortby=rank), at the Services Desk, or via phone at (972) 883-2955.
There are limits on renewals based on borrower level and the type of item. The item will not be renewed if it
has been recalled for another borrower, if borrowing privileges have expired, if ﬁne limits or exceeded, or if the
patron has overdue items. For questions about ﬁnes or checkout periods please refer to the Borrowing From
the Library (https://www.utdallas.edu/library/services/borrowing/) list.
 
Recalls

Circulation Policies : Library - The University of Texas at Dallas
https://atec.utdallas.edu/library/about-the-library/library-policies/circpolicy/
1/3
A recall allows a patron to request most materials that are checked out or the library staﬀ to request materials
for course reserves. Items that check out for fewer than 21 days may not be recalled. Recall requests may be
submitted through Discover (https://utdallas.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/search?
vid=01UT_DALLAS:UTDALMA&lang=en&sortby=rank) or by calling the Information Desk at (972) 883-2955.
The initial borrower will be notiﬁed by email of any due date change. When the item is returned, the requestor
is notiﬁed by email, and the item is held at the Services Desk for 7 days. If the item is not returned by the new
due date, recall ﬁnes of $1/day go into eﬀect.
 
Missing, Lost, and Damaged Materials
If material is missing from the shelves, library staﬀ will conduct a search by request at the Services Desk. If
located, library staﬀ will notify the requestor of the results and hold the material at the Services Desk for 7
days.
Materials that are overdue for more than 60 days are considered lost. If an item that a borrower has checked
out is lost or irreparably damaged, the borrower will be assessed a replacement fee that reﬂects the
replacement cost of the material as determined by the library. In addition to replacement fees, the borrower
will be assessed a $25 processing fee, as well as any existing overdue ﬁnes. Damaged items will not be
returned to patrons, and replacement copies will not be accepted.
Library privileges may be suspended for borrowers who fail to abide by this policy or who have unpaid library
charges. The Library will block a borrower’s course registration or issuance of transcripts for any library
account that includes unpaid charges totaling over $1.
Inquiries concerning a ﬁne or suspension of privileges should be made at the Services Desk or submitted
through an Appeal A Library Fine form (http://www.utdallas.edu/library/services/pay_online/ﬁneappeal/).
