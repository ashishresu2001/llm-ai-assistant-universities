Insurance Requirements
International Students Only
UT System requires all enrolled international students holding F1,
F2, J1 or J2 non-immigrant visas to maintain medical, evacuation
and repatriation insurance coverage while enrolled at a UT System
institution. UT SHIP provides this coverage to international
students. Academic HealthPlans administers UT SHIP, which is
underwritten by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.
Each semester, international students holding these visa types are
automatically enrolled in UT SHIP, and the insurance premium is
charged directly to their tuition and fee bill unless they apply for
and are approved to receive a waiver based on acceptable alternate
insurance coverage. The alternate plan must meet or exceed the
coverage requirements defined by Regent Rule 50402.
International students who wish to apply for a waiver do so through
the electronic application system. Instructions are sent via email
each semester. The insurance coverage requirement applies to all
international students holding F1, F2, J1 or J2 non-immigrant visas
even if they are granted Texas residency status for tuition purposes.
UT Dallas has the discretion to determine what constitutes
sufficient documentation demonstrating approved health insurance
coverage. Acceptable proof of coverage must be written in English
and money listed in U.S. dollars.
Please note:  H-visa holders and any other visa type not listed above
are not considered international students for insurance purposes.
H-visa holders are still eligible for insurance and may enroll for
coverage as domestic students. Visit Get Insurance for more
information.
2024-2025 Waiver Requirements
The UT System student health insurance requirements comply with
the federal Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA).
Alternate insurance plans being submitted for waiver consideration
must comply with the federal PPACA (Patient Protection and
Affordable Care Act ).
Please note that insurance waiver requests granted in the past may
not meet the requirements of the federal PPACA (Patient Protection
and Affordable Care Act ). We believe UT SHIP is a good value for
the coverage it provides and it meets the requirements of the law.
We encourage UT Dallas students to remain enrolled in UT SHIP.

UT SHIP provides health insurance coverage to eligible
students enrolled at a UT System institution.
OPTIONS FOR DOMESTIC STUDENTS
REQUIREMENTS FOR INTERNATIONAL STUDENTS
2024-2025 Policies
Academic HealthPlans administers UT SHIP, which is underwritten
by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Texas.
Policies are subject to change. For more information visit the
benefits page.
Proof of Insurance
Blue Cross Blue Shield sends one insurance card per school year to
policy holders. The card is mailed to the address on record in Orion
as of Census Day. In your first semester of coverage, you should
receive an insurance card two-to-four weeks after Census Day.
Because eligibility for UT SHIP is contingent upon enrollment at UT
Dallas, insurance cards cannot be sent until a student is officially
registered, which is Census Day.
Interim Coverage Letter
If you need to receive medical treatment or fill a prescription
between the start date of the current semester’s insurance policy
and the time you receive your insurance card, contact us to secure
an interim coverage letter. The letter will serve as your temporary
proof of insurance until the insurance company can mail your
official insurance card.
Dependents
All enrollment takes place online. If you need to add dependents or
extend dependent coverage on your policy, visit the enrollment
page. Dependent enrollment cannot be processed until a student’s
enrollment has been updated to reflect the current semester’s
coverage. Dependents can only be added during the open
enrollment period.
